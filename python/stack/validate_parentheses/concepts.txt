In this problem, we need to ensure that whenever a closing parenthesis is read, the last unclosed opening parenthesis matches it.
We also need to ensure that every opening parenthesis is properly closed.

We can verify the first statement by using a stack, and adding each opening parenthesis as we read the string char by char.
Then when we reach a closing parenthesis, we pop from the stack, as the top element is the last unclosed opening parenthesis.
If they don't match, we return false.
Once we have read the entire string, we check to make sure that the stack is empty to verify the second requirement.
