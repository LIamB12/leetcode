The key to this problem is looking at it as a linear system of equations.
A car's position is a function of its speed over time.
Car fleets are the product of an intersection, and after the intersection, both cars follow the slope of the slower car.
From geometry, we know that if car a has a lower y intercept, and a higher slope than car b, they will intersect as we increase time in the positive direction.
We can apply this to the car situation - if a car has a lesser starting position, but higher speed, it will eventually reach the car ahead of it.
This means that a car fleet will always form if that intersection happens before the target distance.
An easy way to verify whether this happens is to compare the time it takes each of them to reach the target, using their constant speed.
If the behind car would reach the target before the car in front, then we know a collision would occur.
In this case, we can disregard the behind car entirely, as if the two were a fleet to begin with.
We can repeat this for every set of 2 cars/fleets in by storing them in reverse sorted order, calculating collisions, and counting the fleets to solve this problem.
