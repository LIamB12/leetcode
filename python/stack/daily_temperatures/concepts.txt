This problem uses a data structure called a Monotonic Decreasing Stack.
Whenever we push a new element, we pop all of the elements that are lesser than it.
This ensures that the stack will always maintain a decreasing order.
We can apply the structure to this problem by reading through the list of temperatures, and pushing them one by one.
We will also keep track of the index each element came from so that we can uipdate the corresponding index in the outpt array once it gets popped.
Whenever we pop an element, it will be because we have found an element greater than it.
We can then add the difference between the popped element's index and our current index to the output array.
