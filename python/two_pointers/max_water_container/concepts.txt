In this problem, we can calculate the amount of water stored between two indicies by multipying the smaller height by the distance between the indicies.
The main concept aside from the two pointers algorithm here is understanding when to move each pointer.
By moving only the pointer with the lower height, we will algorithmically find the largest volume.
