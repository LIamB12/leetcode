In this problem, we use two pointers to traverse the array from the ends to the center, keeping track of the highest bars touched by each pointer.
We decide which pointer to move based on the side with the lower max height so far.
Let's imagine that on the left side, our highest bar so far is height 2, and it is 3 on the right.
We know that no matter what is on the right of our left pointer, the water that can be stored at the current index will be capped at 2.
Anything higher than 2 would simply spill over to the left.
If the bar at our current index is less than 2, we can store water there, so we add the 2 - height[index] to the total
Otherwise, it becomes our new heighest value on the left, and we continue to iterate until every index has been reached, and its water value has been added to the total.
