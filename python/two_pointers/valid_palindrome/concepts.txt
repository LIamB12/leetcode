This problem makes use of the two pointers algorithm to compare characters on either end of the string
We start with 2 pointers on either end, and move them towards the middle one character at a time
If either pointer's character is not alphanumeric, we increment that pointer and iterate, ignoring that char
We then compare the value at each pointer's index, and move the pointers towards the center
