This problem uses the two pointers algorithm to solve the 2 sum problem on a sorted array
The key is the sorted array, allowing us to use pointers instead of hashing, solving the problem with O(1) space
We take the sum of the numbers at both pointers. If it is too large, we decrese the right pointer, and if it is too small, we increase the left pointer.
