We know that a number is the start of a sequence if num - 1 is not in the list.
With this knowledge we can solve the problem in O(n).
We first convert the list into a set, for O(1) lookups.
Then we loop through each number, skipping it if num - 1 is in the list.
If num - 1 is not in the list, we can find the length of the sequence that it starts by increasing num by 1 until num is no longer in the set.
We then compare that length to our previous max sequence length, storing the larger value.
With this method, we 'visit' each number exactly twice, except for sequence starters, which we visit once. This results in an O(n) solution.
