This problem uses matrix manipulation, and  the same HashSet algorithm used in contains-duplicate for validating each row, column, and 3x3 box.
The rows are already constructed for us in the board.
We construct the columns by transposing the board, so that each column is in its own array. This is done using list comprehension, placing board[i][j] in transposed_board[j][i].
The 3x3 boxes are then constructed by looping through each stack of 3 rows, and splitting them into groups of length 3.
