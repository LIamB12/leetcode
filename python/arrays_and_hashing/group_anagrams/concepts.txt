In this problem, we need a way to describe words using just their letters, such that two anagrams would have the same value.
The two main ways to do this are to sort the words, or what I did in this approach, representing them as a length 26 tuple.
Each index represents a letter of the alphabet, and its value holds the number of times that letter appears in the word.
We need a tuple and not a list because it is hashable, so we can map each string's character tuple to an array of anagram strings.
We then return all of the grouped anagram strings by looping through the map, and appending each value.
