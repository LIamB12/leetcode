This problem uses two HashMaps to keep track of the number of occurances of each letter in each word.
Once we know that information, we return false if the length of the two maps are not equal, since the strings would contain some different letters.
Then we can loop through and make sure that the contents of each map are the same.
If they are, we know that each word uses the exact same letters, making them anagrams.
