For this problem, before converting the array to a single string, we add specifying characters denoting each string's length.
We prepend each string with its length, and a single character "#".
We need this in between character to handle multiple digit string lengths, so we know when to stop reading the length specifier.
We then decode the string back to the original array by reading in the length specifier, and creating each word letter by letter.
